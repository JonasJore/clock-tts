# clock-tts

Project where i further elaborate on an [algorithm](https://github.com/JonasJore/coding-challenges/blob/master/daily-programmer/talking_clock.rs) 
that takes in a timestamp from a 24-hour clock and turns it into a sentence.  
For example: `13:00 => It is one AM`. And using this with `tts`library to make the time be spoken out loud.
